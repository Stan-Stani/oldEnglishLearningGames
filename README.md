# Ideas

As you complete translations you gain coins. You can spend coins on items etc. to help you be better at your translations and info gathering.

Gameplay loop.

Pick a mission

Mission part
- knowledge / choice test (historical, situational, did you bring the right supplies for your choice?)
- skill test (more traditional gameplay, platformer etc.)
- translation / language task


E.g. Mission: Gather info about the state of a neighboring village water supply. Is it similar looking to ours? Are their animals healthy?
(Ours are sick. Find the cure.)

Luckily this first village is near the border with your homeland / a port city that's bound to have some people at least somewhat familiar with your tongue.
(Vocabulary introduced.)

Traditional game: Pluck sample feathers from each chicken without getting pecked to death

Language: Record the sick / odd animals: blue cow, green pig etc.
